You should have a folder named models in the current directory(the root of the new project) containing javascript files, each containing a model.
The name of the file doesn't matter.The file format should be as follows:

var obj = {
   Hero : {
     name: 'String',
     id: 'String'
  }
};

module.exports = obj;
